# A-study-about-the-power-of-Giacomini-White-test-in-forecast-evaluation
Forecasting is crucial in statistics and machine learning, enabling accurate predictions and informed decision-making based on historical data patterns. Evaluating forecasting methods involves two key approaches: point and interval forecasting. Point forecasts are assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics are also common in machine learning model evaluations, with lower scores typically indicating better performance. However, a lower metric score does not always guarantee a better model for the entire population. In this paper, I am going to focus on the use of the Giacomini-White (GW) test in comparing predictive ability between two competing forecasting models. This project combines time series analysis and advanced machine learning, utilizing forecasting evaluation, Python, R, statistical tests, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Sequential Learning Models.
